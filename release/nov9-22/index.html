  <p><strong>Announcement of Breaks</strong></p>
  <p>Infrared Studios is announcing that company work days are off on Sundays and Wednesday. This is for religious reasons within the company, and we will not be booking jobs for those days unless we are 100% certain that someone is available. Employees can opt-out and be available those days. Labor will NOT be allowed those days under any circumstance.</p>
  <p><strong>Expanding Employement</strong></p>
  <p>In the last few days, Infrared Studios has created more jobs with the new opportunity of Infrared SEO. This allows people to work from home. </p>
