  <p><strong>Acquisition of TFM</strong></p>
  <p>Infrared Studios has now acquired Thomas Flood Mendez, a landscaping company located in northern Illinois. We, at Infrared, decided to buy Thomas Flood Mendez because we saw a chance to help it grow, and one of our top level executives works for Thomas Flood Mendez (TFM for short). The acquisition should not impact operations, and there will be 0 job cuts, if anything we are expecting to gain more jobs in the near future. The benefits of the acquisition are, more income streams, better PR, and a ton of marketting. The sale of TFM has been finalized and we will be taking steps to fully include them into the Infrared lifeline.</p>
  <p><strong>More Job Opportunities</strong></p>
  <p>We have recently had enough income and profit to start hiring new employees at a massive rate. We have employed 10 people in the last 3 days and expect it to be higher in the next few months. With the acquisition of TFM (Thomas Flood Mendez) we are expected to be bringing in an average of 1800 dollars monthly from TFM alone. This along with our current revamp of web pages, game development and other software related jobs, we expect our profits to be going up drastically, allowing us to employ more people. We also expect to expand our company into more of Europe and Canada.</p>
